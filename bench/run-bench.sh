# Deterministic A/B renderer benchmark for DOOM-N64 on the ares emulator.
#
# Builds the BENCH ROM (make BENCH=1, shareware DOOM1.WAD, Docker), launches it
# in ares, runs a fixed scripted scenario through the shipping uncapped+
# interpolated render path, scrapes the result, and ALWAYS tears ares down.
#
# Frame cost is measured inside the ROM in VR4300 ticks (get_ticks(), the CP0
# cycle counter) and reported as emulated-hardware us/frame and FPS -- this is
# independent of host emulation speed, so an ares that can't hit full speed does
# not bias the numbers.
#
# Result sink (primary): libdragon debugf() -> emulated ISViewer -> ares stdout,
# captured to a log and grepped for the BENCH_RESULT line. ares disables ISViewer
# for ROMs > 64 MB; the shareware ROM is ~10 MB so this is fine.
#
# Output: one machine-readable line on stdout:
#   BENCH_RESULT frames=N avg_us=.. p95_us=.. max_us=.. min_us=.. \
#                avg_fps=.. min_fps=.. p95_fps=..
#
# Usage:
#   bench/run-bench.sh [label]
# Env overrides:
#   ROM=path        skip the build, run an existing BENCH .z64
#   KEEP_ROM=path   copy the built ROM here after the run (e.g. baseline)
#   TIMEOUT=180     hard cap (seconds) on the ares run
#   ARES=/usr/bin/ares
